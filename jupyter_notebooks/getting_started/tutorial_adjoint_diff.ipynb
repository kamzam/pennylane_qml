        "*Author: PennyLane dev team. Posted: 23 Nov 2021. Last updated: 23 Nov\n2021.*\n\n[Classical automatic\ndifferentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#The_chain_rule,_forward_and_reverse_accumulation)\nhas two methods of calculation: forward and reverse. The optimal choice\nof method depends on the structure of the problem; is the function\nmany-to-one or one-to-many? We use the properties of the problem to\noptimize how we calculate derivatives.\n\nMost methods for calculating the derivatives of quantum circuits are\neither direct applications of classical gradient methods to quantum\nsimulations, or quantum hardware methods like parameter-shift where we\ncan only extract restricted pieces of information.\n\nAdjoint differentiation straddles these two strategies, taking benefits\nfrom each. On simulators, we can examine and modify the state vector at\nany point. At the same time, we know our quantum circuit holds specific\nproperties not present in an arbitrary classical computation.\n\nQuantum circuits only involve:\n\n1)  initialization,\n\n$$|0\\rangle,$$\n\n2)  application of unitary operators,\n\n$$|\\Psi\\rangle = U_{n} U_{n-1} \\dots U_0 |0\\rangle,$$\n\n3)  measurement, such as estimating an expectation value of a Hermitian\n    operator,\n\n$$\\langle M \\rangle = \\langle \\Psi | M | \\Psi \\rangle.$$\n\nSince all our operators are unitary, we can easily \\\"undo\\\" or \\\"erase\\\"\nthem by applying their adjoint:\n\n$$U^{\\dagger} U | \\phi \\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle.$$\n\nThe **adjoint differentiation method** takes advantage of the ability to\nerase, creating a time- and memory-efficient method for computing\nquantum gradients on state vector simulators. Tyson Jones and Julien\nGacon describe this algorithm in their paper [\\\"Efficient calculation of\ngradients in classical simulations of variational quantum\nalgorithms\\\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02823) .\n\nIn this demo, you will learn how adjoint differentiation works and how\nto request it for your PennyLane QNode. We will also look at the\nperformance benefits.\n\nTime for some code\n==================\n\nSo how does it work? Instead of jumping straight to the algorithm,\nlet\\'s explore the above equations and their implementation in a bit\nmore detail.\n\nTo start, we import PennyLane and PennyLane\\'s numpy:\n"

        "Finally to Derivatives!\n=======================\n\nWe showed how to calculate the same thing a bunch of different ways. Why\nis this useful? Wherever we cut, we can stick additional things in the\nmiddle. What are we sticking in the middle? The derivative of a gate.\n\nFor simplicity\\'s sake, assume each unitary operation $U_i$ is a\nfunction of a single parameter $\\theta_i$. For non-parametrized gates\nlike CNOT, we say its derivative is zero. We can also generalize the\nalgorithm to multi-parameter gates, but we leave those out for now.\n\nRemember that each parameter occurs twice in $\\langle M \\rangle$: once\nin the bra and once in the ket. Therefore, we use the product rule to\ntake the derivative with respect to both locations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\langle M \\rangle}{\\partial \\theta_i} =\n\\langle 0 | U_1^{\\dagger} \\dots \\frac{\\text{d} U_i^{\\dagger}}{\\text{d} \\theta_i} \\dots M \\dots U_i \\dots U_1 | 0\\rangle.$$\n\n$$+ \\langle 0 | U_1^{\\dagger} \\dots U_i^{\\dagger} \\dots M \\dots \\frac{\\text{d} U_i}{\\text{d} \\theta_i}  \\dots U_1 |0\\rangle$$\n\nWe can now notice that those two components are complex conjugates of\neach other, so we can further simplify. Note that each term is not an\nexpectation value of a Hermitian observable, and therefore not\nguaranteed to be real. When we add them together, the imaginary part\ncancels out, and we obtain twice the value of the real part:\n\n$$= 2 \\cdot \\text{Re}\\left( \\langle 0 | U_1^{\\dagger} \\dots U_i^{\\dagger} \\dots M \\dots \\frac{\\text{d} U_i}{\\text{d} \\theta_i}  \\dots U_1 |0\\rangle \\right).$$\n\nWe can take that formula and break it into its \\\"bra\\\" and \\\"ket\\\"\nhalves for a derivative at the $i$ th position:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\langle M \\rangle }{\\partial \\theta_i } =\n2 \\text{Re} \\left( \\langle b_i | \\frac{\\text{d} U_i }{\\text{d} \\theta_i} | k_i \\rangle \\right)$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\\langle b_i | = \\langle 0 | U_1^{\\dagger} \\dots U_n^{\\dagger} M U_n \\dots U_{i+1},$$\n\nNotice that $U_i$ does not appear in either the bra or the ket in the\nabove equations. These formulas differ from the ones we used when just\ncalculating the expectation value. For the actual derivative\ncalculation, we use a temporary version of the bra,\n\n$$| \\tilde{k}_i \\rangle = \\frac{\\text{d} U_i}{\\text{d} \\theta_i} | k_i \\rangle$$\n\nand use these to get the derivative\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\langle M \\rangle}{\\partial \\theta_i} = 2 \\text{Re}\\left( \\langle b_i | \\tilde{k}_i \\rangle \\right).$$\n\nBoth the bra and the ket can be calculated recursively:\n\n$$| b_{i} \\rangle = U^{\\dagger}_{i+1} |b_{i+1}\\rangle,$$\n\n$$| k_{i} \\rangle = U^{\\dagger}_{i} |k_{i+1}\\rangle.$$\n\nWe can iterate through the operations starting at $n$ and ending at $1$.\n\nWe do have to calculate initial state first, the \\\"forward\\\" pass:\n\n$$|\\Psi\\rangle = U_{n} U_{n-1} \\dots U_0 |0\\rangle.$$\n\nOnce we have that, we only have about the same amount of work to\ncalculate all the derivatives, instead of quadratically more work.\n\nDerivative of an Operator\n-------------------------\n\nOne final thing before we get back to coding: how do we get the\nderivative of an operator?\n\nMost parametrized gates can be represented in terms of Pauli Rotations,\nwhich can be written as\n\n$$U = e^{i c \\hat{G} \\theta}$$\n\nfor a Pauli matrix $\\hat{G}$, a constant $c$, and the parameter\n$\\theta$. Thus we can easily calculate their derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{d} U}{\\text{d} \\theta} = i c \\hat{G} e^{i c \\hat{G} \\theta} = i c \\hat{G} U .$$\n\nLuckily, PennyLane already has a built-in function for calculating this.\n"

The `\"lightning.qubit\"`\ndevice does not support backpropagation, so backpropagation derivatives\nlose the speedup from an optimized simulator.\n\nWith adjoint differentiation on `\"lightning.qubit\"`, you can get the\nbest of both worlds: fast and memory efficient.\n\nBut how fast?
