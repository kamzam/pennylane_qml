        "Optimizing noisy circuits with Cirq\n===================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": Learn how noise can affect the\noptimization and training of quantum computations.\n:property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/noisy_circuit_optimization_thumbnail.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\npytorch\\_noise PyTorch and noisy devices\n:::\n\n*Author: Nathan Killoran --- Posted: 01 June 2020. Last updated: 16 June\n2021.*\n\n![](../demonstrations/noisy_circuit_optimization/noisy_qubit.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nUntil we have fault-tolerant quantum computers, we will have to learn to\nlive with noise. There are lots of exciting ideas and algorithms in\nquantum computing and quantum machine learning, but how well do they\nsurvive the reality of today\\'s noisy devices?\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nQuantum pure-state simulators are great and readily available in a\nnumber of quantum software packages. They allow us to experiment,\nprototype, test, and validate algorithms and research ideas\\-\\--up to a\ncertain number of qubits, at least.\n\nBut present-day hardware is not ideal. We\\'re forced to confront\ndecoherence, bit flips, amplitude damping, and so on. Does the presence\nof noise in near-term devices impact their use in, for example,\n`variational quantum algorithms </glossary/variational_circuit>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"doc\"}? Won\\'t our models, trained so carefully in simulators, fall\napart when we run on noisy devices?\n\nIn fact, there is some optimism that variational algorithms may be the\nbest type of algorithms on near-term devices, and could have an in-built\nadaptability to noise that more rigid textbook algorithms do not\npossess. Variational algorithms are somewhat robust against the fact\nthat the device they are run on may not be ideal. Being variational in\nnature, they can be tuned to \\\"work around\\\" noise to some extent.\n\nQuantum machine learning leverages a lot of tools from its classical\ncounterpart. Fortunately, there is great evidence that machine learning\nalgorithms can not only be robust to noise, but can even benefit from\nit! Examples include the use of [reduced-precision arithmetic in deep\nlearning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3045118.3045303), the\nstrong performance of [stochastic gradient\ndescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent), and\nthe use of \\\"dropout\\\" noise to [prevent\noverfitting](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf).\n\nWith this evidence to motivate us, we can still hope to find, extract,\nand work with the underlying quantum \\\"signal\\\" that is influenced by a\ndevice\\'s inherent noise.\n\nNoisy circuits: creating a Bell state\n-------------------------------------\n\nLet\\'s consider a simple quantum circuit which performs a standard\nquantum information task: the creation of an entangled state and the\nmeasurement of a [Bell\ninequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) (also known\nas the [CHSH\ninequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality)).\n\nSince we\\'ll be dealing with noise, we\\'ll need to use a simulator that\nsupports noise and density-state representations of quantum states (in\ncontrast to many simulators, which use a pure-state representation).\n\nFortunately, [Cirq](https://cirq.readthedocs.io) provides mixed-state\nsimulators and noisy operations natively, so we can use the\n[PennyLane-Cirq plugin](https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io) to carry\nout our noisy simulations.\n"
