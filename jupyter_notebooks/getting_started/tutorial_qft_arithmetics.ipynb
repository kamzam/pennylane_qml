Using arithmetic operations we\ncan understand the world around us and solve many of our daily tasks.\n\nArithmetic is crucial for the implementation of any kind of algorithm in\nclassical computer science, but also in quantum computing. For this\nreason, in this demo we are going to show an approach to defining\narithmetic operations on quantum computers. The simplest and most direct\nway to achieve this goal is to use the quantum Fourier transform (QFT),\nwhich we will demonstrate on a basic level.\n\nIn this demo we will not focus on understanding how the QFT is built, as\nwe can find a great explanation in the [Xanadu Quantum\nCodebook](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/F.1). Instead, we will develop the\nintuition for how it works and how we can best take advantage of it.\n\nMotivation\n==========\n\nThe first question we have to ask ourselves is whether it makes sense to\nperform these basic operations on a quantum computer. Is the goal purely\nacademic or is it really something that is needed in certain algorithms?\nWhy implement in a quantum computer something that we can do with a\ncalculator?\n\nWhen it comes to basic quantum computing algorithms like the\nDeustch--Jozsa or Grover\\'s algorithm, we might think that we have never\nneeded to apply any arithmetic operations such as addition or\nmultiplication. However, the reality is different. When we learn about\nthese algorithms from an academic point of view, we work with a\nready-made operator that we never have to worry about, the *oracle*.\nUnfortunately, in real-world situations, we will have to build this\nseemingly magical operator by hand. As an example, let\\'s imagine that\nwe want to use Grover\\'s algorithm to search for [magic\nsquares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square). To define the\noracle, which determines whether a solution is valid or not, we must\nperform sums over the rows and columns to check that they all have the\nsame value. Therefore, to create this oracle, we will need to define a\nsum operator within the quantum computer.\n\nThe second question we face is why we should work with the QFT at all.\nThere are other procedures that could be used to perform these basic\noperations; for example, by imitating the classical algorithm. But, as\nwe can see in, it has already been proven that the QFT needs fewer\nqubits to perform these operations, which is nowadays of vital\nimportance.\n\nWe will organize the demo as follows. Initially, we will talk about the\nFourier basis to give an intuitive idea of how it works, after which we\nwill address different basic arithmetic operations. Finally, we will\nmove on to a practical example in which we will factor numbers using\nGrover\\'s algorithm.\n\nQFT representation \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n\nTo apply the QFT to basic arithmetic operations, our objective now is to\nlearn how to add, subtract and multiply numbers using quantum devices.\nAs we are working with qubits, ---which, like bits, can take the values\n$0$ or $1$---we will represent the numbers in binary. For the purposes\nof this tutorial, we will assume that we are working only with integers.\nTherefore, if we have $n$ qubits, we will be able to represent the\nnumbers from $0$ to $2^n-1$.\n\nThe first thing we need to know is PennyLane\\'s standard for encoding\nnumbers in a binary format. A binary number can be represented as a\nstring of 1s and 0s, which we can represent as the multi-qubit state\n\n$$\\vert m \\rangle = \\vert \\overline{q_0q_1...q_{n-1}}\\rangle,$$\n\nwhere the formula to obtain the equivalent decimal number $m$ will be:\n\n$$m= \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}2^{n-1-i}q_i.$$\n\nNote that $\\vert m \\rangle$ refers to the basic state generated by the\nbinary encoding of the number $m$. For instance, the natural number $6$\nis represented by the quantum state $\\vert 110\\rangle,$ since\n$\\vert 110 \\rangle = 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1\\cdot 2^1+0\\cdot 2^0 = 6$.\n\nLet's see how we would represent all the integers from $0$ to $7$ using\nthe product state of three qubits, visualized by separate Bloch spheres\nfor each qubit.\n\n![Representation of integers using a computational basis of three\nqubits.](/demonstrations/qft_arithmetics/3_qubits_computational_basis.gif){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nThe [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) is a way\nof graphically representing the state of a qubit. At the top of the\nsphere we place the state $\\vert 0 \\rangle,$ at the bottom\n$\\vert 1 \\rangle$, and in the rest of the sphere we will place the\npossible states in superposition. It is a very useful representation\nthat helps better visualize and interpret quantum gates such as\nrotations.\n:::\n\nWe can use the\n`qml.BasisEmbedding <pennylane.BasisEmbedding>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} template to obtain the binary representation in a simple\nway. Let\\'s see how we would code the number $6$.\n"

        "As we can see, the first qubit---the $0$-th wire---is placed on top and\nthe rest of the qubits are below it. However, this is not the only way\nwe could represent numbers. We can also represent them in different\nbases, such as the so-called *Fourier base*.\n\nIn this case, all the states of the basis will be represented via qubits\nin the XY-plane of the Bloch sphere, each rotated by a certain amount.\n\nHow do we know how much we must rotate each qubit to represent a certain\nnumber? It is actually very easy! Suppose we are working with $n$ qubits\nand we want to represent the number $m$ in the Fourier basis. Then the\n$j$-th qubit will have the phase:\n\n$$\\alpha_j = \\frac{2m\\pi}{2^{j}}.$$\n\nNow we can represent numbers in the Fourier basis using three qubits:\n\n![Representation of integers using the Fourier basis with three\nqubits](/demonstrations/qft_arithmetics/3_qubits_fourier_basis.gif){.align-center\nwidth=\"90.0%\"}\n\nAs we can see, the third qubit will rotate $\\frac{1}{8}$ of a turn\ncounterclockwise with each number. The next qubit rotates $\\frac{1}{4}$\nof a full turn and, finally, the first qubit rotates half a turn for\neach increase in number.\n\nAdding a number to a register\n=============================\n\nThe fact that the states encoding the numbers are now in phase gives us\ngreat flexibility in carrying out our arithmetic operations. To see this\nin practice, let's look at the situation in which want to create an\noperator Sum such that:\n\n$$\\text{Sum(k)}\\vert m \\rangle = \\vert m + k \\rangle.$$\n\nThe procedure to implement this unitary operation is the following:\n\n1.  We convert the state from the computational basis into the Fourier\n    basis by applying the QFT to the $\\vert m \\rangle$ state via the\n    `~pennylane.QFT`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} operator.\n2.  We rotate the $j$-th qubit by the angle $\\frac{2k\\pi}{2^{j}}$ using\n    the $R_Z$ gate, which leads to the new phases,\n    $\\frac{2(m + k)\\pi}{2^{j}}$.\n3.  We apply the QFT inverse to return to the computational basis and\n    obtain $m+k$.\n\nLet\\'s see how this process would look in PennyLane.\n"

        "Perfect, we have obtained $\\vert 0111 \\rangle$, which is equivalent to\nthe number $7$ in binary!\n\nNote that this is a deterministic algorithm, which means that we have\nobtained the desired solution by executing a single shot. On the other\nhand, if the result of an operation is greater than the maximum value\n$2^n-1$, we will start again from zero, that is to say, we will\ncalculate the sum modulo $2^n-1.$ For instance, in our three-qubit\nexample, suppose that we want to calculate $6+3.$ We see that we do not\nhave enough memory space, as $6+3 = 9 > 2^3-1$. The result we will get\nwill be $9 \\pmod 8 = 1$, or $\\vert 001 \\rangle$ in binary. Make sure to\nuse enough qubits to represent your solutions! Finally, it is important\nto point out that it is not necessary to know how the QFT is constructed\nin order to use it. By knowing the properties of the new basis, we can\nuse it in a simple way.\n\nAdding two different registers\n==============================\n\nIn this previous algorithm, we had to pass to the operator the value of\n$k$ that we wanted to add to the starting state. But at other times,\ninstead of passing that value to the operator, we would like it to pull\nthe information from another register. That is, we are looking for a new\noperator $\\text{Sum}_2$ such that\n\n$$\\text{Sum}_2\\vert m \\rangle \\vert k \\rangle \\vert 0 \\rangle = \\vert m \\rangle \\vert k \\rangle \\vert m+k \\rangle.$$\n\nIn this case, we can understand the third register (which is initially\nat $0$) as a counter that will tally as many units as $m$ and $k$\ncombined. The binary decomposition will make this simple. If we have\n$\\vert m \\rangle = \\vert \\overline{q_0q_1q_2} \\rangle$, we will have to\nadd $1$ to the counter if $q_2 = 1$ and nothing otherwise. In general,\nwe should add $2^{n-i-1}$ units if the $i$-th qubit is in state\n$\\vert 1 \\rangle$ and 0 otherwise. As we can see, this is the same idea\nthat is also behind the concept of a controlled gate. Indeed, observe\nthat we will, indeed, apply a corresponding phase if indeed the control\nqubit is in the state $\\vert 1\\rangle$. Let us now code the\n$\\text{Sum}_2$ operator.\n"
