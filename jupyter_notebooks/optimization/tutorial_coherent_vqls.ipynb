        "Coherent Variational Quantum Linear Solver {#coherent_vqls}\n==========================================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": This demonstration extends the variational\nquantum linear solver to solve linear equations defined by a\nprobabilistic coherent operation. :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/cvqls_zoom.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_vqls Variational Quantum Linear Solver\n:::\n\n*Author: Andrea Mari --- 06 November 2019. Last updated: 15 January\n2021.*\n\nIn this tutorial we propose and implement an algorithm that we call\n*coherent variational quantum linear solver* (CVQLS). This is inspired\nby the VQLS proposed in Ref. \\[1\\] (implemented in a\n`previous demo <tutorial_vqls>`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}), with an\nimportant difference: the matrix $A$ associated to the problem is\nphysically applied as a probabilistic coherent operation. This approach\nhas some advantages and disadvantages and its practical convenience\ndepends on the specific linear problem to be solved and on experimental\nconstraints.\n\n![](../demonstrations/coherent_vqls/cvqls_circuit.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nWe first define the problem and the general structure of the CVQLS. As a\nsecond step, we consider a particular case and we solve it explicitly\nwith PennyLane.\n\n### The problem\n\nWe are given a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix $A$ which can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of $L$ unitary matrices $A_0, A_1, \\dots A_{L-1}$,\ni.e.,\n\n$$A = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l A_l,$$\n\nwhere $c_l$ are arbitrary complex numbers. Importantly, we assume that\neach of the unitary components $A_l$ can be efficiently implemented with\na quantum circuit acting on $n$ qubits.\n\nWe are also given a normalized complex vector in the physical form of a\nquantum state $|b\\rangle$, which can be generated by a unitary operation\n$U$ applied to the ground state of $n$ qubits. , i.e.,\n\n$$|b\\rangle = U_b |0\\rangle,$$\n\nwhere again we assume that $U_b$ can be efficiently implemented with a\nquantum circuit.\n\nThe problem that we aim to solve is that of preparing a quantum state\n$|x\\rangle$, such that $A |x\\rangle$ is proportional to $|b\\rangle$ or,\nequivalently, such that\n\n$$|\\Psi\\rangle :=  \\frac{A |x\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}} \\approx |b\\rangle.$$\n\n### Coherent Variational Quantum Linear Solver (CVQLS)\n\nWe approximate the solution $|x\\rangle$ with a variational quantum\ncircuit, i.e., a unitary circuit $V$ depending on a finite number of\nclassical real parameters $w = (w_0, w_1, \\dots)$:\n\n$$|x \\rangle = V(w) |0\\rangle.$$\n\nThe parameters should be optimized in order to maximize the overlap\nbetween the quantum states $|\\Psi\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$. We define the\nfollowing cost function,\n\n$$C = 1- |\\langle b | \\Psi \\rangle|^2,$$\n\nsuch that its minimization with respect to the variational parameters\nshould lead towards the problem solution.\n\nThe approach used in Ref. \\[1\\] is to decompose the cost function in\nterms of many expectation values associated to the individual components\n$A_l$ of the problem matrix $A$. For this reason, in the VQLS of Ref.\n\\[1\\], the state vector proportional to $A |x\\rangle$ is not physically\nprepared. On the contrary, the idea presented in this tutorial is to\nphysically implement the linear map $A$ as a coherent probabilistic\noperation. This approach allows to prepare the state\n$|\\Psi\\rangle :=  A |x\\rangle/\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}$\nwhich can be used to estimate the cost function of the problem in a more\ndirect way.\n\n#### Coherently applying $A$\n\nThe problem of coherently applying a liner combination of unitary\noperations has been already studied in Ref. \\[2\\] and here we follow a\nvery similar approach.\n\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that the coefficients\n$c=(c_1, c_2, \\dots c_L)$ appearing in the definition of $A$ represent a\npositive and normalized probability distribution, i.e.,\n\n$$c_l \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall l,  \\qquad \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l=1.$$\n\nIndeed the complex phase of each coefficient $c_l$ can always be\nabsorbed into the associated unitary $A_l$, obtaining in this way a\nvector of positive values. Moreover, since the linear problem is defined\nup to a constant scaling factor, we can also normalize the coefficients\nto get a probability distribution.\n\nFor simplicity, since we can always pad $c$ with additional zeros, we\nassume that $L=2^m$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nLet us consider a unitary circuit $U_c$, embedding the square root of\n$c$ into the quantum state $|\\sqrt{c}\\rangle$ of $m$ ancillary qubits:\n\n$$|\\sqrt{c} \\rangle =  U_c |0\\rangle = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\sqrt{c_l} | l \\rangle,$$\n\nwhere $\\{ |l\\rangle \\}$ is the computational basis of the ancillary\nsystem.\n\nNow, for each component $A_l$ of the problem matrix $A$, we can define\nan associated controlled unitary operation $CA_l$, acting on the system\nand on the ancillary basis states as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nCA_l \\, |j\\rangle |l' \\rangle  =\n\\Bigg\\{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\left(A_l \\otimes \\mathbb{I}\\right) \\; |j\\rangle |l \\rangle \\quad \\; \\mathrm{for}\\; l'=l \\\\\n\\qquad \\qquad |j\\rangle |l' \\rangle  \\quad \\mathrm{for}\\; l'\\neq l\n\\end{array},\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\ni.e., the unitary $A_l$ is applied only when the ancillary system is in\nthe corresponding basis state $|l\\rangle$.\n\nA natural generalization of the [Hadamard\ntest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_test_(quantum_computation)),\nto the case of multiple unitary operations, is the following (see also\nthe figure at the top of this tutorial):\n\n1.  Prepare all qubits in the ground state.\n2.  Apply $U_c$ to the ancillary qubits.\n3.  Apply the variational circuit $V$ to the system qubits.\n4.  Apply all the controlled unitaries $CA_l$ for all values of $l$.\n5.  Apply $U_c^\\dagger$ to the ancillary qubits.\n6.  Measure the ancillary qubits in the computational basis.\n7.  If the outcome of the measurement is the ground state, the system\n    collapses to\n    $|\\Psi\\rangle :=  A |x\\rangle/\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}$.\n    If the outcome is not the ground state, the experiment should be\n    repeated.\n\n#### Estimating the cost function\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the previous steps represent the most\ndifficult part of the algorithm. Once we have at our disposal the\nquantum system prepared in the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$, it is very easy to\ncompute the cost function. Indeed one could simply continue the previous\nprotocol with the following two steps:\n\n8.  Apply $U_b^\\dagger$ to the system.\n9.  Measure the system in the computational basis. The probability of\n    finding it in the ground state (given the ancillary qubits measured\n    in their ground state), is\n    $|\\langle 0 | U_b^\\dagger |\\Psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle b | \\Psi \\rangle|^2$.\n\nSo, with sufficiently many shots of the previous experiment, one can\ndirectly estimate the cost function of the problem.\n\nImportantly, the operations of steps 7 and 8 commute. Therefore all the\nmeasurements can be delayed until the end of the quantum circuit (as\nshown in the figure at the top of this tutorial), making the structure\nof the experiment more straightforward.\n\n### A simple example\n\nIn this tutorial we apply the previous theory to the following simple\nexample based on a system of 3 qubits, which was already considered in\nRef. \\[1\\] and also reproduced in PennyLane\n(`VQLS <tutorial_vqls>`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}):\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{align}\nA  &=  c_0 A_0 + c_1 A_1 + c_2 A_2 = \\mathbb{I} + 0.2 X_0 Z_1 + 0.2 X_0, \\\\\n\\\\\n|b\\rangle &= U_b |0 \\rangle = H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\\rangle,\n\\end{align}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere $Z_j, X_j, H_j$ represent the Pauli $Z$, Pauli $X$ and Hadamard\ngates applied to the qubit with index $j$.\n\nThis problem is computationally quite easy since a single layer of local\nrotations is enough to generate the solution state, i.e., we can use the\nfollowing simple ansatz:\n\n$$|x\\rangle = V(w) |0\\rangle = \\Big [  R_y(w_0) \\otimes  R_y(w_1) \\otimes  R_y(w_2) \\Big ]  H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\\rangle.$$\n\nIn the code presented below we solve this particular problem, by\nfollowing the general scheme of the CVQLS previously discussed.\nEventually we will compare the quantum solution with the classical one.\n\nGeneral setup\n-------------\n\nThis Python code requires *PennyLane* and the plotting library\n*matplotlib*.\n"
