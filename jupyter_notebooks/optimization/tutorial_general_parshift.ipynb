We will investigate the form such\nfunctions usually take and demonstrate how we can *reconstruct* them as\nclassical functions, capturing the full dependence on the input\nparameter. Once we have this reconstruction, we use it to compute\nanalytically exact derivatives of the quantum function. We implement\nthis in two ways: first, by using autodifferentiation on the classical\nfunction that is produced by the reconstruction, which is flexible with\nrespect to the degree of the derivative. Second, by computing the\nderivative manually, resulting in generalized parameter-shift rules for\nquantum functions that is more efficient (regarding classical cost) than\nthe autodifferentiation approach, but requires manual computations if we\nwant to access higher-order derivatives. All we will need for the demo\nis the insight that these functions are Fourier series in their\nvariable, and the reconstruction itself is a [trigonometric\ninterpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation).\n\nA full description of the reconstruction, the technical derivation of\nthe parameter-shift rules, and considerations for multivariate functions\ncan be found in the paper [General parameter-shift rules for quantum\ngradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12390) . The core idea to consider\nthese quantum functions as Fourier series was first presented in the\npreprint [Calculus on parameterized quantum\ncircuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06323). We will follow, but there\nalso are two preprints discussing general parameter-shift rules: an\nalgebraic approach in [Analytic gradients in variational quantum\nalgorithms: Algebraic extensions of the parameter-shift rule to general\nunitary transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08131) and one\nfocusing on special gates and spectral decompositions, namely\n[Generalized quantum circuit differentiation\nrules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01218) .\n\n| \n\n![Function reconstruction and differentiation via parameter\nshifts.](../demonstrations/general_parshift/thumbnail_genpar.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nCost functions arising from quantum gates\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWe start our investigation by considering a cost function that arises\nfrom measuring the expectation value of an observable in a quantum\nstate, created with a parametrized quantum operation that depends on a\nsingle variational parameter $x$. That is, the state may be prepared by\nany circuit, but we will only allow a single parameter in a single\noperation to enter the circuit. For this we will use a handy gate\nstructure that allows us to tune the complexity of the operation \\-\\--\nand thus of the cost function. More concretely, we initialize a qubit\nregister in a random state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and apply a layer of Pauli-$Z$\nrotations `RZ` to all qubits, where all rotations are parametrized by\nthe *same* angle $x$. We then measure the expectation value of a random\nHermitian observable $B$ in the created state, so that our cost function\noverall has the form\n\nHere, $U(x)$ consists of a layer of `RZ` gates,\n\nLet\\'s implement such a cost function using PennyLane. We begin with\nfunctions that generate the random initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and the\nrandom observable $B$ for a given number of qubits $N$ and a fixed seed:\n"

        "Again, we obtain a perfect reconstruction of $E(x)$ up to numerical\nerrors. We see that the deviation from the original cost function became\nlarger than for equidistant shifts for some of the qubit numbers but it\nstill remains much smaller than any energy scale of relevance in\napplications. The reason for these larger deviations is that some\nevaluation positions $x_\\mu$ were sampled very close to each other, so\nthat inverting the matrix $C$ becomes less stable numerically.\nConceptually, we see that the reconstruction does *not* rely on\nequidistant evaluations points.\n\nDifferentiation via reconstructions\n===================================\n\nNext, we look at a modified reconstruction strategy that only obtains\nthe odd or even part of $E(x)$. This can be done by slightly modifying\nthe shifted positions at which we evaluate $E$ and the kernel functions.\n\nFrom a perspective of implementing the derivatives there are two\napproaches, differing in which parts we derive on paper and which we\nleave to the computer: In the first approach, we perform a partial\nreconstruction using the evaluations of the original cost function $E$\non the quantum computer, as detailed below. This gives us a function\nimplemented in `jax.numpy` and we may afterwards apply `jax.grad` to\nthis function and obtain the derivative function. $E(0)$ then is only\none evaluation of this function away. In the second approach, we compute\nthe derivative of the partial reconstructions *manually* and directly\nimplement the resulting shift rule that multiplies the quantum computer\nevaluations with coefficients and sums them up. This means that the\npartial reconstruction is not performed at all by the classical\ncomputer, but only was used on paper to derive the formula for the\nderivative.\n\n*Why do we look at both approaches?*, you might ask. That is because\nneither of them is better than the other for *all* applications. The\nfirst approach offers us derivatives of any order without additional\nmanual work by iteratively applying `jax.grad`, which is very\nconvenient. However, the automatic differentiation via JAX becomes\nincreasingly expensive with the order and we always reconstruct the\n*same* type of function, namely Fourier series, so that computing the\nrespective derivatives once manually and coding up the resulting\ncoefficients of the parameter-shift rule pays off in the long run. This\nis the strength of the second approach. We start with the first\napproach.\n\nAutomatically differentiated reconstructions\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe implement the partial reconstruction method as a function; using\nPennyLane\\'s automatic differentiation backends, this then enables us to\nobtain the derivatives at the point of interest. For odd-order\nderivatives, we use the reconstruction of the odd part, for the\neven-order derivatives that of the even part.\n\nWe make use of modified [Dirichlet\nkernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_kernel)\n$\\tilde{D}_\\mu(x)$ and equidistant shifts for this. For the odd\nreconstruction we have\n\nwhich we can implement using the reformulation\n\nfor the kernel.\n"
